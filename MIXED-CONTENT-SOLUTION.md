# MIXED CONTENT ISSUE - SOLUTION SUMMARY

## ðŸš¨ Problem Identified
**Mixed Content Policy Violation**: Your Vercel frontend is served over HTTPS (`https://graphicinfohelpdesk.vercel.app/`) but was trying to make HTTP requests to `http://192.168.21.94:3000`. Modern browsers block this for security.

## âœ… Solution Applied

### 1. **Removed HTTP Fallback**
- Eliminated all HTTP fallback mechanisms from `script.js`
- Configured script to use **HTTPS ONLY** (`https://192.168.21.94:3443`)
- No more mixed content errors

### 2. **Simplified Configuration**
```javascript
const API_CONFIG = {
    BASE_URL: 'https://192.168.21.94:3443',
    // HTTPS is required for Vercel (HTTPS) to backend communication
};
```

### 3. **Clear Error Messages**
Added helpful error messages when HTTPS connection fails:
- Check if HTTPS server is running on port 3443
- Verify SSL certificate configuration
- Confirm firewall allows port 3443

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps Required

### **Start the HTTPS Server**
You need to start the HTTPS server on the machine at `192.168.21.94`:

**Option 1: Remote Desktop**
1. Remote Desktop to `192.168.21.94`
2. Navigate to `C:\Users\JMITCHELL\Desktop\TicketingSystem`
3. Double-click `start-https.bat` or run `.\start-https-remote.ps1`

**Option 2: Command Line**
```powershell
# On the server machine (192.168.21.94):
cd "C:\Users\JMITCHELL\Desktop\TicketingSystem"
$env:HTTPS_PORT = "3443"
$env:HTTP_PORT = "3000"
node server.js
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### **1. Verify HTTPS Server is Running**
From any machine, test:
```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 192.168.21.94 -Port 3443
```

### **2. Test API Endpoint**
Once server is running, test in browser console:
```javascript
testConnection()
```

Expected result: `âœ… HTTPS connection successful! (401 expected without auth)`

### **3. Full Integration Test**
1. Ensure HTTPS server is running on port 3443
2. Refresh your Vercel frontend
3. Try logging in with credentials
4. Should work without mixed content errors

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Checklist

- [ ] HTTPS server running on `192.168.21.94:3443`
- [ ] SSL certificates in `certs/` directory
- [ ] Firewall allows port 3443
- [ ] Vercel frontend uses HTTPS URLs only
- [ ] No more mixed content errors in browser console
- [ ] Login/authentication working properly

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- **HTTPS is mandatory** for production Vercel deployment
- Self-signed certificates will show browser warnings but will work
- Users may need to accept the certificate warning once
- Consider getting a proper SSL certificate for production use

## ðŸ“ž If You Need Help

If the HTTPS server won't start:
1. Check if certificates exist in `certs/` folder
2. Run `node generate-cert.js` to create certificates
3. Verify ports 3000 and 3443 are not in use
4. Check Windows Firewall settings
5. Ensure Node.js dependencies are installed (`npm install`)

The frontend script is now **Mixed Content compliant** and will only use HTTPS! ðŸŽ‰
